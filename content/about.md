## I'm Nikhil.

I started as a hardware engineer because I like making things real, the ground truth of the physical world. Four patents granted (with five more filed) came out of that phase, but what I've realized is that building is the easy part for me. The real challenge, and the one I care most about, is shaping the direction: deciding what gets built, why it matters, and how it impacts the people around it.

I've led small, ambitious teams, navigated international projects, and delivered systems that work. But the lesson I keep coming back to is this: the physical world has infinite solutions. Within the laws of physics, there are endless ways to make something function, a hundred ways to fasten wood, a thousand ways to build a circuit.

The harder question isn't can we build it? It's should we? Society's choices, about which technologies we pursue, which problems we solve, and which ones we ignore, are the true challenge.

Hardware will always be a personal passion. Professionally, my focus is on guiding teams, clarifying direction, and making sure we build not just effectively, but responsibly.

## What I Do

Leading small, agile teams with empathy and purpose

Connecting technical and non-technical stakeholders across borders

Evaluate and in turn translate ambitious ideas into systems that deliver real impact
