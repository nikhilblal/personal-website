<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My friend wanted to go to a light festival, and so we went illuminated. We chose projects the night before and hacked them together. The jacket reflects the breathing of the user; as the wearerâ€™s chest expands the lighting intensifies, and conversely, on contraction, the lighting dims. The expansion and contraction were measured by a Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) that I strapped to my chest with the mildly elastic belt I was wearing at the time. As a cyclist I want to remind people I am not just a binary dot hovering in the night: I am a living, breathing human - please do not run me over!</p>
