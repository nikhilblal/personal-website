                <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>One day whilst working on some solid modelling, a package from China came across my desk with no discernible or obvious origin, other than the fact that it was addressed to me. Inside were 10 black boxes with 4 wires attached to each. It was peculiar to say the least. Thinking nothing of it, I filed it away on the shelf for future evaluation. Months later, I grabbed the box, and spent some time trying to figure out what they were. I come to find out that they were portable, high voltage generators!</p>
<h3>Method:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Probed contacts and took resistance readings</li>
<li>Googled keywords of “black box, 4 wires”</li>
<li>Attempted to search for Chinese characters indicated on side to no avail</li>
<li>Returned back to the multimeter and voltage analysis</li>
<li>Surmised that the red and yellow leads could be related to a power source</li>
<li>Set up power supply with low current cut-off, connected leads to power supply, dial up current limit slowly, and was pleasantly surprised by a brilliant ignition spark</li>
</ol>
<p>Following this adventure, I made it into a hand held high voltage generator.</p>
