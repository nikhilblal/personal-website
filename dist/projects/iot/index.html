<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Directed and led team to develop a simple waterproof test box that enabled communication from a manhole. Long thought to be impossible due to the assumption that the subterranean communication would be hindered by the manhole cover and thick cement walls, an informal Faraday cage; despite this assumption, we found an antenna and cellular enabled micro-controller configuration that allowed us to communicate from a manhole, from up to 5 ft deep. The tech developed in our mini-testbox was then grafted onto an existing gamma build unit and demonstrated that wireless communication can be enabled from an actual sampling device.</p>
