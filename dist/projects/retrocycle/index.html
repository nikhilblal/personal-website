<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A work in progress, this is my antique motor-bicycle, originally manufactured for the Charles Williams Stores sometime between 1917-1922, the bike was originally built for a small gas engine. I received the bike without wheels, and a skip tooth chain with an odd-sized pitch (1.1&quot;). I added hand fabricated wheels, laced with a direct drive rear hub from ebikekit and a Sturmey-Archer front drum brake, built a front brake sensor out of a hard drive magnet and a hall effect sensor, used old LiPo batteries from Biobotâ€™s samplers, and various other parts I had lying around.</p>
